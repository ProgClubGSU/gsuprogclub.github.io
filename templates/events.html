We will be covering how you can create your own simulation using Java! If you're curious to learn more about how the game works or the libraries we’ll be using to draw check out the links below.<br>

                        <div class="event-description">We will have our third competitive programming event to put your skills to the test! You'll enter as a team of 3 (if you don't have a team, you can form one in the Discord)-- whichever team can solve the most problems in the set time wins! You don't have to be amazing at programming to attend. This is a great way to learn and practice problem-solving and meet other people who are also interested in improving. These problem-solving skills will be very useful for technical interviews.</div>
